Description: Open source development for Neo-Geo
 ngdevkit is a ASM/C/C++ software development kit for
 the Neo-Geo AES or MVS hardware. It provides a complete
 toolchain for cross compiling to the m68k and z80 CPUs,
 a C library for easy hardware access, and a set of tools
 for managing character and sprite ROMs. It also comes with
 an open-source BIOS replacement for running your ROM under
 your favorite emulator, and a m68k-enabled GDB for
 source-level-debugging.
