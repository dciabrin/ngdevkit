ngdevkit is a C/C++ software development kit for the Neo-Geo
AES or MVS hardware. It includes:

   * A toolchain for cross compiling to m68k, based on GCC
     5.5 and newlib for the C standard library.

   * C headers for accessing the hardware. The headers follow the
     naming convention found at the [NeoGeo Development Wiki][ngdev].

   * Helpers for declaring ROM information (name, DIP, interrupt
     handlers...)

   * A C and ASM cross-compiler for the z80 (SDCC 3.7), for developing
     your music and sound driver.

   * An open source replacement BIOS for testing your ROMs
     under you favorite emulator.

   * Tools for managing graphics for fix and sprite ROM.

   * Support for source-level debugging with GDB!

   * A modified version of the emulator [GnGeo][gngeo], with support
     for libretro's GLSL shaders and remote debugging!

   * A simple scanline pixel shader for a nice retro look!



## How to use the devkit

### Installing pre-built binary packages

There are nightly packages available for Linux, macOS and Windows, so
you get the most up-to-date devkit without recompiling the entire
toolchain any time there is an update in git.

#### Linux

If you are running an Ubuntu or Debian distribution, you can install
pre-built debian packages from the ngdevkit PPA, as well as a couple
of dependencies for the examples ROMs:

    add-apt-repository -y ppa:dciabrin/ngdevkit
    apt-get update
    apt-get install ngdevkit ngdevkit-gngeo
    # the remaining packages are only requred for the examples
    apt-get install pkg-config autoconf zip imagemagick sox libsox-fmt-mp3

#### macOS

If you are running on macOS, you can install [brew][brew]
packages, available in the ngdevkit tap:

    # If you haven't done it yet, make sure XCode is installed first
    sudo xcode-select --install
    brew tap dciabrin/ngdevkit
    brew install ngdevkit ngdevkit-gngeo
    # make sure you use brew's python3 in your shell
    export PATH=/usr/local/opt/python3/bin:$PATH
    pip3 install pygame
    # the remaining packages are only required for the examples
    brew install pkg-config autoconf automake zip imagemagick sox

Some macOS versions are not currently pre-built (macOS 11 Intel and
M1), as our CI provider doesn't currently offer free hosted agents
yet, so it might take some time to install the packages.

#### Windows

You can run ngdevkit natively on Windows, via the [MSYS2][msys2]
environment and an [official Python 3 release for Windows][pywin] from
https://www.python.org.

In a MSYS2 shell, you first need to install PyGame in your Python 3
environment (`i.e.` not the python available in MSYS2). For example,
assuming Python 3 is installed for user `ngdevkit`:

    C:/Users/ngdevkit/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python -m pip install pygame

Then, in order to install pre-built ngdevkit packages, add the
ngdevkit repository into your MSYS2 installation, and install the
required packages:

    echo -e '\n[ngdevkit]\nSigLevel = PackageOptional\nServer = https://dciabrin.net/msys2-ngdevkit/$arch' >> /etc/pacman.conf
    pacman -Sy
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ngdevkit mingw-w64-x86_64-ngdevkit-gngeo
    # the remaining packages are only required for the examples
    pacman -S autoconf automake make zip mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick mingw-w64-x86_64-sox

An old version of ngdevkit supported Windows 10 via [WSL][wsl], but it
is now deprecated in favour of the native MSYS2 environment.

### Build the included examples

The devkit comes with a series of examples to demonstrate how to use
the compiler and tools. Once ngdevkit packages are installed, you can
clone the [ngdevkit-examples][examples] repository:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/dciabrin/ngdevkit-examples examples

And build all the examples with the following commands if you are running
Linux:

    cd examples
    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure
    make

For macOS, make sure you use brew's python3 and gmake:

    cd examples
    export PATH=/usr/local/opt/python3/bin:$PATH
    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure
    gmake

For Windows, you have to build the examples with extra flags and
pass the location of the external Python 3 installation written
as an MSYS2 path:

    cd examples
    # ensure Windows-native binaries are available in PATH
    export PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH
    autoreconf -I/mingw64/share/aclocal -iv
    ./configure --enable-msys2 --with-python=/c/Users/ngdevkit/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python
    make


### Running the emulator

Once you have built the examples, go into a subdirectory to
test the compiled example and run GnGeo from the makefile:

    cd examples/01-helloworld
    make gngeo
    # or run "make gngeo-fullscreen" for a more immersive test

If you are running a recent macOS, [System Integrity Protection][sip]
may prevent you from running GnGeo from make, so you may need to run
it from your terminal:

    eval $(gmake -n gngeo)


### Debugging your programs

The devkit uses a modified version of GnGeo which supports remote
debugging via GDB. In order to use that feature on the example ROM,
you first need to start the emulator in debugger mode:

    cd examples/01-helloworld
    # example ROM is named puzzledp
    ngdevkit-gngeo -i rom puzzledp -D

With argument `-D`, the emulator waits for a connection from a GDB
client on port `2159` of `localhost`.

Then, run GDB with the original ELF file as a target instead of the
final ROM file:

    cd examples/01-helloworld
    m68k-neogeo-elf-gdb rom.elf

The ELF file contains all the necessary data for the debugger,
including functions, variables and source-level line information.

Once GDB is started, connect to the emulator to start the the debugging
session. For example:

    (gdb) target remote :2159
    Remote debugging using :2159
    0x00c04300 in ?? ()
    (gdb) b main.c:52
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x57a: file main.c, line 52.
    (gdb) c



### Building the devkit from sources

If you want to build from source, this repository is the main entry
point: it provides the necessary tools, headers, link scripts and open
source BIOS to build your homebrew roms.  The rest of the devkit is
split into separate git repositories that are automatically cloned at
build time:

   * [ngdevkit-toolchain][toolchain] provides the GNU toolchain,
     newlib, SDCC and GDB.

   * [gngeo][gngeo] and [emudbg][emudbg] provide a custom GnGeo with
     support for GLSL shaders and remote gdb debugging.

   * [ngdevkit-examples][examples] shows how to use the devkit and how
     to program the Neo Geo hardware. It comes with a GnGeo
     configuration to run your roms with a "CRT scanline" pixel
     shader.

There are dedicated instructions to build ngdevkit for [Linux](README-linux.md),
[macOS](README-macos.md) or [Windows](README-msys2.md).



## History

This work started a _long_ time ago (2002!) and was originally called
neogeodev on [sourceforge.net][sfnet]. Since then, a community has
emerged at [NeoGeo Development Wiki][ngdev], and it is a real treasure
trove for Neo-Geo development. Coincidentally, they are hosted at
[`neogeodev.org`][ngdev], so I decided to revive my original project on github
as `ngdevkit` :P


## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Charles Doty][cdoty] for his `Chaos` demo, this is how I
learned about booting the console, and fiddling with sprites!

Thanks to Mathieu Peponas for [GnGeo][gngeo] and its effective
integrated debugger. Thanks to the contributors of the [mame][mame]
project for such a great emulator.

A big thank you goes to Furrtek, ElBarto, Razoola...and all the NeoGeo
Development Wiki at large. It is an amazing collection of information,
with tons of hardware details and links to other Neo-Geo homebrew
productions!
