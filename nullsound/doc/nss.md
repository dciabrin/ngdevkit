# NSS: music playback with nullsound streams

nullsound can play music modules composed with Furnace [1]. Those modules are processed by `nsstool` and converted into a format that can be played back easily on the Z80.

Internally, nullsound achieves music playback by reading a nullsound stream (NSS), which is its internal representation of an entire music, split into bytecodes that represent atomic actions (e.g. play a note, load an instrument, start a effect, wait some time...). Unlike VGM, NSS organizes the music by YM2610 channel and pattern for de-duplication, and bytecode is designed to yield efficient data storage.

This document details the current level of support for Furnace features in NSS. It also highlights the current differences between NSS and Furnace, to help you compose tracks that should play back nicely in nullsound.


## Currently supported Furnace features

* The supported Furnace module format is "Neo Geo MVS" (single chip, YM2610), as well as "Neo Geo MVS (extended channel 2)".

* When ADPCM-A or ADPCM-B instruments use samples encoded in `.wav` format, they are automatically converted to ADPCM by ngdevkit. Some details worth noting:

  - Right now, `nsstool` supports `.wav` samples whose format is either 16-bit PCM or 8-bit PCM, mono channel. Additionally, samples used for ADPCM-A instruments are expected to be 18.5KHz.

  - If an ADPCM-B sample is used for looping, make sure that the sample's length is a multiple of 512 sample units, otherwise you will hear popping artifacts. This is because on the YM2610, a single ADPCM-B sample unit is encoded as 4-bits, and sample playback can only start and end on 256 bytes boundaries.

* Instrument macros are currently only implemented for SSG instruments, with the following limitations:

  - Only the `sequence` macro type can used to configure SSG properties. Macro types `ADSR` and `LFO` are not supported and there is no plan to support them.

  - Within a sequence macro, each step is 1 tick long. That is, each time the YM2610 triggers an IRQ during music playback, a step of the macro is being evaluated. Unlike in Furnace, there is no native support in NSS for step length or step delay.

  - Macro looping is currently different from what Furnace allows. Currently, NSS groups property updates by steps. When the loop is reached, it starts again from the configured step, which means all properties are re-evaluated from this step. This means you can't have loops for two different properties. This is going to improve in the future to match Furnace's semantics.

  - SSG Auto-envelope feature is currently broken, SSG instruments using that feature can be processed by `nsstool`, but the resulting playback is invalid. Do not use it.

* If you use SSG in your Furnace module, and SSG instruments uses the volume envelope bit for the channel, be aware that this will prevent you from fading out your module while it's playing. This is because the YM2610 has no support in hardware to change the volume of the envelope generator.
